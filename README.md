# titanic_survivors
The sinking of Titanic was on of the most infamous shipwrecks ever in the history of mankind. 
Although it seems that the factors responsible for the survival of the onboarders was their gender,class & status in the society; we would like to take a deeper look into the data and try to predict if some other factors played a role as well! 

We are provided with the data of who onboarded the ship and also a sample submission file which predicts the survival of the passengers on the basis of gender. The provided data in divided into train and test data for our convenience.
